What will happen when I add the next snippet of code to my Terminator fun page?

    <script>
        function sayonara( name ) {
            console.log( 'Sayonara ' + name + '!' );
        }

        sayonara( '</script><script>console.log(\'I will come back!\')</script>' );
    </script>

Why?

How could you fix it?
