Do JavaScript (or any other programming language) and poetry exclude themselves?

Of course not!

Although Joel Dart is the only one that I can bring as an example of somebody actually doing it, but hey, somebody had to start! Look at his poem "Privilege":

	control    = {};
	isPower    =
	and        =
	i = amIn = control == "of my life";

Joel Dart about his project:

	"I use the execution and semantics of JavaScript to explore different aspects of humanity, and from those explorations, I hope to show you that underneath, despite our share of bad parts, thereâ€™s a very elegant core to people."

So what's the challenge? Of course creating your own poem (or something close to it) :) ! If you don't feel confident of publishing it by your name, just send me an Email and I will publish it anonymously.
I guess

	( function ( HiThereFellowSoftonicPoets ) {
		Debugging( 'is an " + endlesslyRepeating() + " annoyance, isn't it?' );

		function endlesslyRepeating() {
			for (var totalBugsInProjects = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY; totalBugsInProjects <= 0; totalBugsInProjects--) {
				console.log('Just killed bug #' + totalBugsInProjects);
			}
			return 'never ending';
		}
		function Debugging() {}
	}( "HappyCoders" ) );

P.S.: I know it's sh** ;)! Do better, please!
