To accomplish a task you need to detect Internet Explorer browsers without using browser sniffing.

The function to detect the browser can be executed in...

* Opera
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Phantom
* Internet Explorer

... and it should return **true** only if the browser is Internet Explorer.

The function should detect only that browser is Internet Explorer, versions are not relevant, but you must perform the action with only one code.

Replace the *FILL THE CODE* comment with your own code to perform the requested task.


	function isIE()
	{
		// FILL THE CODE
	}
